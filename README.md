# SC-Zip-Tools

These tool are used for compressing/decompressing Supercell's game assets, _specifically_ for CSV and TOML files. Just drag and drop the files onto the tool (OR use it via CLI arguments), and it will do the work for you. Make sure to run `setup.py` before using any scripts!

The `.pyw` ([python no-console extension](https://docs.python.org/2/using/windows.html#executing-scripts)) file should be run using `Python`. It has been used to prevent unnecessary console flashing. If you are unable to run `.pyw` files, rename them to `.py` . Requires Python version >=3.5

Video Demonstration: (Soon)

For any errors or feedback, feel free to message me anytime on discord`@generic_name_1911`.

## Features:

- The tool is **Cross-Platform**. That is, it works on all major operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- Supports **Batch Conversion**. You can use it to convert multiple files at once.
- **Same Directory** output. The script saves the decompressed files in the same folder as the originals, no matter where you run it from.
- **Open Source**. Licensed under GNU GPLv3.
- **Supported compression formats** (from sc-compression):
  - LZMA
  - SC
  - SCLZ
  - SIG
  - ZSTD
